In this research, the development of a procedure for objectively evaluating the quality of human-like speech generated by artificial synthesis methods is proposed. Detailed in this document is the methodology adopted in the implementation of a neural network system, capable of predicting the subjective score of a synthesized voice. Training and evaluation of said model is carried out on a custom database generated from a number of different text to speech algorithms, as well as recordings of real human speech, and digitally altered versions of both of those groups. These recordings were then assessed subjectively via an online MOS-like test performed by \color{red} [\textit{Completar con el numero de participantes de la encuesta subjetiva}] \color{black}. From the obtained results we conclude that \color{red} [\textit{Completar con los resultados obtenidos (correlación de la metrica obtenida respecto de las evaluaciones subjetivas, y añadir conclusiones mas relevantes}] \color{black}
